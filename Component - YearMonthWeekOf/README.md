# Overview

The **Year Month Week Of** component is built using **Power Fx** and allows users to filter time-based data by **year**, **month**, and **week of**.  
All date calculations are performed dynamically based on the custom properties selected.

The outputs of the component generate a Table of dates within the Week of range which then can be used for filtering against other data sources.
